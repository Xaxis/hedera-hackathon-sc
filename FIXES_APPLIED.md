# ✅ FIXES APPLIED - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Wallet State Not Persisting Across Pages ✅
**Problem**: Wallet connection was lost when navigating between pages

**Solution**:
- Added `localStorage` persistence to `wallet-context.tsx`
- Added `useEffect` to restore connection on page load
- Added event listeners for MetaMask account/chain changes
- Wallet now stays connected across page navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/context/wallet-context.tsx`

---

### Issue 2: Copy Button Showing Error Alert ✅
**Problem**: Copy button showed "Copy failed. Please manually..." alert

**Solution**:
- Improved clipboard copy with multiple fallback methods
- Added iOS-specific handling
- Changed error alert to user-friendly prompt dialog
- Now tries 3 different copy methods before showing prompt

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/create-equity-token-form.tsx`

---

### Issue 3: Confusing Property Creation Flow ✅
**Problem**: 
- Users had to create equity token separately
- Then manually copy token ID
- Then paste into property form
- Confusing two-step process

**Solution**:
- **Removed** "Equity Token ID" field from property form
- Property creation now **automatically deploys all 3 contracts**:
  1. Property Token (ERC-1400)
  2. PropertySale Contract
  3. DividendDistributor Contract
- Single-step process - just fill form and click create!

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/create-property-form.tsx`

---

### Issue 4: "Asset Tokenization SDK not available" Error ✅
**Problem**: Form wasn't detecting connected wallet properly

**Solution**:
- Added `useWallet` hook to property form
- Check for `walletAccount` instead of `hederaConnected`
- Better wallet state detection
- Clear error messages if wallet not connected

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/create-property-form.tsx`

---

### Issue 5: Poor Error Messages ✅
**Problem**: Generic error messages didn't help users understand what went wrong

**Solution**:
- Added detailed console logging with emojis for easy tracking
- Added helpful error messages for common issues:
  - "Transaction rejected" → Tells user to approve all 3 transactions
  - "Insufficient funds" → Tells user to get HBAR from portal.hedera.com
  - "SDK not available" → Tells user to refresh page
  - "MetaMask not available" → Tells user to install MetaMask
- Added step-by-step progress logging (Step 1/3, 2/3, 3/3)

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/create-property-form.tsx`
- `apps/web/lib/hedera/realTokenDeployment.ts`

---

### Issue 6: No Visual Feedback During Deployment ✅
**Problem**: Users didn't know what was happening during contract deployment

**Solution**:
- Added informative UI section explaining what will happen
- Shows that 3 contracts will be deployed
- Warns that MetaMask will popup 3 times
- Shows estimated cost (~10 HBAR)
- Console logs show progress for each step

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/components/create-property-form.tsx`
